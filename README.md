# ❄️ Home-manager managed dotfiles ❄️

My humble home-manager config for MacOS

## Workflow

- Emacs for editing config files or systems programming. Also magit is ❤️
- Nvim when I forget I have Emacs
- Starship as my shell prompt
- Fish as default shell
- Alacritty + zellij or Ghostty, depends how much I want to show off
